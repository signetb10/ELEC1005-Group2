Template of v and v is not yet provided, need to wait for the template. 

Note: testcases fall into the validation process (doing the functions correctly), but template provided should clarify if the verification process is also required. 

Note: profile page is to be limited to edit profile, security and log out. Sign in with Google and sign in with Apple won't be implemented into PowerApps. 

Note: After reading from numerous articles about testcases and how to write them, I found this website to be the most effective. https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/how-to-write-test-cases-with-examples 


List of the testcases. 

1) login, see if when an existing user inputs their username and password if the program allows them to access their account.
2) Menu, see if the program adds the meals the user selected into their saved meals list.
3) Portions, see if the amounts of the ingredients changes depending on if the user changes the portions required for the meal.
4) Profile: do profile details appear when the profile button is pressed.
5) Log out: does the program log the user out when log out button is pressed. 

Formatted list of testcases.
